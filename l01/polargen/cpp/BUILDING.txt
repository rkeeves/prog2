# Ubuntu

Just use make's rebuild target.

```
make rebuild
```


# Windows

If you are on win... well, I  can feel your pain.
Mingw lacks c++14 and upper support when I last checked.

Cygwin is okay, but you have to use XWindow etc.
VS Compiler on the other hand is extremely good, but you should use it with Visual Studio IDE. :)
